Migration
=========

This project uses D3.js, Mapbox, and Leaflet to build a zoomable hexbin map. The
data is from Edward Miguel's deworming in Africa experiments.

Files in this repo:

1. migration.py: This is a very small python script that formats the data
properly.
2. africa_hex.html: This is the D3.js/Leaflet code that generates the map and
the hexbins.

You can see the map rendered at www.warren-r.com.
